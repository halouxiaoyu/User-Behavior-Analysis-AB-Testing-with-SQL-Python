# User Behavior Analysis Project

A practical analysis of user behavior data using SQL queries and Python statistical testing.

## What This Project Does
- Extracts user metrics (retention, activity) from a database using SQL
- Performs AB test analysis with t-tests and chi-square tests in Python
- Creates basic visualizations of the results

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For data extraction
- **Python**: For analysis and visualization
- **Libraries**: pandas, scipy, seaborn

## Files Included
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries for user metrics
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full analysisï¼Œ for generating plots

## How to Use
Open the Jupyter notebook to run the analysis

## Example Findings
The difference in purchasing power between the two groups was not significant (p far greater than 0.05)

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
